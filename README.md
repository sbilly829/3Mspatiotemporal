# 3M Spatiotemporal Analysis

## Background
In recent years more attention has been given to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, due to their widespread use and persistence in the environment and the bodies of humans and animals. Through DOJ action, EPA has obtained a wide range of documents from 3M related to PFAS, many of which contain spatial data. Work has been done to extract meaningful spatial data from these documents, leading to the current goal of developing tools to perform spatiotemporal analysis on the data and further our understanding of how these chemicals behave in the environemnt.
